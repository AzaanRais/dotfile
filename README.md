# [Dotfiles](https://github.com/AzaanRais/dotfile)

- These are my dotfiles for alacritty, bash, bpytop, flameshot, gitconfig, gtk-2.0, gtk-3.0, gtk-4.0, htop, neofetch, nitrogen, phocus and qtile.

## Installation
- If you wish to install my dotfiles (I have not configured some programs just yet), you first need to install GNU Stow.

- After that you can simply run script.sh, make sure to backup your own config files though because this will OVERWRITE your pre-existing config.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:AzaanRais/dotfile
cd dotfile
chmod +x script.sh
./script.sh
```
